					<div>
						<p align=”justify” style="color:black">I remember X coming to me and telling me that I was being too authoritative. Y came to me the very next day and said that
							I wasn't authoritative enough and I couldn't hold the society together. While people called me different names and gave unasked advice for how
							to 'act' as a President, in the end they were just labels. Boy, did I have self doubts day and night! I learnt the hard way that based on what
							people on the internet or off-internet say about you, you cannot validate or invalidate yourself. I have been out of my comfort zone every
							single day. I know I have been rude multiple times but someone had to play that role. Many of my decisions were questioned and rightfully so.
							You can always choose to give/not give an explanation if  you feel that your step is towards the betterment of the society. Your people will
							understand. There will also be many others who will misunderstand. I never complained about the stress I underwent in this journey (trust me
							it was a lotttttt) simply because I made a conscious decision when I stood up in the elections. I may have learnt many things the hard way but
							now that I have enough time to introspect, I wouldn't want it to be any different. I have been blessed to form life-long friendships and been
							in awe of people and the potential they carry within themselves. I made the society my place of worship. I kept it above everything else.
						  <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							I wouldn't say it was the smartest of decisions that I made. I waited for one day when I would get to relax and have fun with each one of you,
							not as a President but as a friend. I met some of you so late that we barely got to know each other. I wouldn't be lying if I said I waited for
							my farewell for 3 years. Well, a pandemic hit us along with other heart wrenching stuff. I hate to say goodbye like this but there's no alternative
							left. I hope you make your life one hell of a party in reality and not for the sake of social media. Do good things for people without letting
							them know. Choose your tribe wisely. Everything else you need to get by, you will learn in time. I can only tell you how to survive college.
							Uske aage ka I still have to figure out. With the economy crashing, a pandemic that isn't ending anytime soon, businesses not coming back,
							our favorite places being shut down, people losing lives everyday, we are entering a hell of an outer world. We don't know when we would get to
							hug our loved ones, sit at IHC or experience Mandi House. I don't know if things are ever going to be truly normal. I am scared, I wouldn't deny
							that but I am also ready for anything that life throws my way. Also, all that spiritual stuff you see online? It's the new cool. My journey wasn't
							easy. I never expected it to be. I have sailed through the storms with some really amazing people by my side. You guys know who you are. I cannot
							thank you enough. For everything and more, thank you, Spilled Ink. You've been a roller coaster ride.</p>

						<p style="color:black">Hi kiddos. Hope everybody is safe and healthy. I wanted to have an in person farewell conversation with you all.
Spilled Ink is family, always been. Honestly, I wasn't standing up for the VP. Since I already had all sorts of experiences in school I guess,
I didn't have the excitement. However, the society needed me and I was already handling the inner work, so it happened and I won.
Being in the panel teaches you a lot. Three different people, three different minds trying to make fair together for everyone is a big task.
But, I feel it's right to have three extremely different people in charge because there's individual inputs and less biasness.
It has got to be like that at all points without fail.
The pressure and work for all three position holders is huge. Well, it's a part of being in charge right?
To everyone (members and the panel), wherever I go, for me it always comes down to who you are in person,
especially respecting each other's views and people in general. I've had all sorts of experiences in the society.
And the main thing that hit me this year was trying to learn myself and teach others the way to communicate in a proper manner.
<br>
<br>
<br>
As writers, I think it's extremely important for all of us to word our sentences and our emotions better.
There's a very thin line between being rude and straightforward. And we all should try and learn it.
There's always, always a way to put our thoughts out completely and kindly. I have no doubts about it.
These things go all ways. There's got to be respect amongst the panel members, amongst the society members
and between the panel and the members without anyone having to point it out. And you all are good to go!
The panel's decisions (sometimes the entire team is confused and it's the panel's job to think quicker instead of wasting time)
should be respected but in case you feel you got an opinion against it, do point it out, in a proper manner.
The panel members should be acting from a place of being leaders and not bosses. Again a thin line here.
You are all such talented beautiful people and you've got a very long way to go. Be grateful for
what you have right now, be kind, do your thing, refrain from talking of people behind their backs,
treat everyone as your family and you will indeed be happy. I miss you guys so much.</p>

<br>
  <ul style="color:black">
  <li><strong>Q: Which year had the best society t-shirts/hoodies?</strong></li>
  <li>A: Hands down this one! And it is THE BEST HOODIE in the entire college! (Some people have even bribed me to get one for them)</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Q: Out of all the Spilled Ink events you were a part of, which one was your favourite?</strong></li>
  <li>A: While every single event has had its own crazy fun elements attached (because duh Spilled Ink) the (okay and Sonal might kill me for this) impromptu,
		last minute shift of Alliteration’19 to Lodhi Garden actually turned out to be the most memorable and surreal experience. The fact that it was so unplanned
		and yet so well managed by the entire team, ekdum mast location, amazing crowd all in all perfect mahaul for someone like me. It definitely is the scariest
		and yet the most favourite memory!</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Q: What was the most fun society hangout spot? And does any particular memory come to mind?</strong></li>
  <li>A: For me it has always been the Amphi. I have never stepped into the amphi without running into society members.
		As for a particular memory, I think everyday of interacting, talking, getting to know especially the newbies,
		in January when we were preparing for the Alumni Meet was great! I made a lot of cute friends.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Q: What is that one thing Spilled Ink gave you/taught you that would stay with you for a long time?</strong></li>
  <li>A: It gave me a lot of confidence in my own writing, something I have always been afraid to share.
		It was an experience on its own and has given me a space to not only get to know myself but also challenge myself as well. </li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Q: Now that you're bidding college (not the society) goodbye, do you have any regrets?</strong></li>
  <li>A: Well I guess the only and the biggest regret that not only me but we all must be feeling is the fact that we missed out on so much in the last few months.
		I'll regret not having a farewell because I have looked forward to it since first year (like most if not all, of us) .
College has been beautiful for me in every aspect and I feel suspended between so many different emotions.
I hope that someday, one day, when all of this is over I finally get some closure.</li>

		<li><strong>Q: What is your most treasured memory with Spilled Ink?</strong></li>
 <li>A: The adrenaline rush during all the event preparations.</li>
 <br>
 <li><strong>Q: Which year had the best society t-shirts/hoodies?</strong></li>
 <li>A: 2019-2020.</li>
 <br>
 <li><strong>Q: Out of all the Spilled Ink events you were a part of, which one was your favourite?</strong></li>
 <li>A: Alumni meet and the 2018's farewell party at Shreya's flat. Such beautiful vibes.</li>
 <br>
 <li><strong>Q: What was the most fun society hangout spot? And does any particular memory come to mind?</strong></li>
 <li>A: IHC for intimate conversations and bonding, always. Amphi - chill zone! Memories are just so many…
	 Evenings spent at and around the campus with the society members during the prep days or after the events was always amazing.</li>
 <br>
 <li><strong>Q: What is that one thing Spilled Ink gave you/taught you that would stay with you for a long time?</strong></li>
 <li>A: Appreciation for Kriti Marjara❤️. Her work, her conversations and her presence speaks it all. I'm her secret admirer shhh..
 Teamwork and management maybe. Shit I don't have anything intelligent to say. Hopefully, vice prez's msg would be better.</li>
 <br>
 <li><strong>Q: Now that you're bidding college (not the society) goodbye, do you have any regrets?</strong></li>
 <li>A: No regrets honestly. Just an unfulfilled wish, maybe we can say. I expected to have some people for life like best buddies,
	 bffs whatever you want to call it, some close connections with people from various parts of the country since DU is a place for diversity. Sadly, not happening.</li>

	 <li><strong>Q: What is your most treasured memory with Spilled Ink?</strong></li>
<li>A: Fest wala time for sure. From all the preparations to the wrap up, sab kuch khatam hone ke baad saath baith kar khana khana.
	It has always felt like a bond stronger than any I have made in my own department in the past 3 years.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Q: Which year had the best society t-shirts/hoodies?</strong></li>
<li>A: Last year's hoodie. Peela rang aur kuch khayal acche se saath jaate hai, as Shroti says.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Q: Out of all the Spilled Ink events you were a part of, which one was your favourite?</strong></li>
<li>A: Lafz-e-mehfil. As someone who’s a performer herself, it’s always great to see people come together and celebrate art,
	and for awhile forget everything else going on in their lives.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Q: What was the most fun society hangout spot? and does any particular memory come to mind?</strong></li>
<li>A: IHC and amphi I guess. Baaki piche chai point bhi yaar. The memories there are countless and those of you who know, you know.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Q: What is that one thing Spilled Ink gave you/taught you that would stay with you for a long time?</strong></li>
<li>A: Spilled Ink has taught me a lot, I have grown immensely within the society and outside it but what will stay with me the most is: you don't
	need to be with someone the entire time to create a strong bond, sabko apna time lagta hai ghulne milne mei and that's okay.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Q: Now that you're bidding college (not the society) goodbye, do you have any regrets?</strong></li>
<li>A: Well, don’t we all? No matter how much we try, there’ll always be something jo chooth jaata hai humse.
	The amount of love I have for this society, I do regret not contesting for the President, among other things.</li>

			  <ul style="color:black">

	<li><strong>Q: What is your most treasured memory with Spilled Ink?</strong></li>
	<li>A: There's a bunch of them, and it's quite difficult, also unfair to pick just one.
	I’ll always count the memories that we made and the experiences that we shared at the last fest as one of the most treasured ones.
	Despite all the ups and downs, the shortcomings, we managed to pull through. Being a part of the seniormost batch in this particular
	fest is one of the things that made the said fest different from the rest.</li>
<br>
	<li><strong>Q: Which year had the best society t-shirts/hoodies?</strong></li>
	<li>A: 2nd year (grey t-shirts), for sure. Very comfortable. Also,the hoodies win hands down, considering we’d never worn one for the society before.</li>
<br>
	<li><strong>Q: Out of all the Spilled Ink events you were a part of, which one was your favourite?</strong></li>
	<li>A: All of them, but particularly, the reunion (Alumni Meet) that we held this year. It was lovely to have everyone in the same room, all at once.</li>
<br>
	<li><strong>Q: What was the most fun society hangout spot? And does any particular memory come to mind?</strong></li>
	<li>A: Amphitheatre. I’ll never forget getting together with the society for meetings,
		to finish working on the decor and to casually hang out at the amphitheatre after having successfully conducted an event.</li>
<br>
	<li><strong>Q: What is that one thing Spilled Ink gave you/taught you that would stay with you for a long time?</strong></li>
	<li>A: No matter how busy you are, you must always devote some time to the things that you enjoy doing,
		things that help you unwind. Spilled Ink taught me how important it is to focus on things other than just academics,
		the essence of doing more than just that for it is what makes you complete. More than anything else, it taught me teamwork,
		love and the value of having a bunch of people around to support you, help you grow, encourage you, inspire you, always.</li>
<br>
	<li><strong>Q: Now that you're bidding college (not the society) goodbye, do you have any regrets?</strong></li>
	<li>A: There has been no dearth of rather bad, bitter experiences, but if I’m ever given the chance to go back in time and do something about them,
		I honestly wouldn’t change a thing. I don’t regret anything at all (not yet, and hopefully, that’s exactly how I’ll continue to feel once
		I’m actually, really done with college).</li>
